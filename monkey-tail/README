README for @, also known as monkey-tail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What?
-----

@ is a swiss army knife for the *Nix user, and is self-contained and portable.


Why?
----

Well, I feel that it's nice to have a collection of simple commands in a
separate utility, rather than "polluting" the shell namespace.

You can hang @ on your belt, along with your shell, editor and your C compiler.


How?
----

Copy @ into your usual directory for scripts, etc

Then, simply run:

	@ list-commands

For example, to show disk usage of the current directory:

 	@ disk-usage

Or, find the disk hogs in your downloads directory:

	@ disk-hogs ~/Downloads


Externals
---------

@ can merge pieces of code into itself, to provide extra commands, etc.
Additionally, "externals" can then be updated from their source.

For example:

	@ external-add https://github.com/lmartinking/monkey-tail/raw/master/externals/hello-world

Will import the "hello-world" external, and all commands contained within will
be available. For instance:

	@ hello-world

To remove "hello-world", simply use:

	@ external-remove hello-world

If you have modified an external which is embedded into @, you can extract
the code using:

	@ external-code <external-name>

You can append code to an external using:

	@ external-append 


Creating Your Own External
--------------------------

An external is simply a kind of bash script with "# @" on the first line

Each command in @ is a bash function, prefixed with _ (underscore). For example:

	# @
	_my-command () {
	 echo "Hello there!"
	}

Once merged into @ (using external-add <file>), can be accessed by:

	@ my-command

@ provides a few built in functions, and eventually there will be more.
Please do take a look at the source code!

For more examples of externals, take a look at:
